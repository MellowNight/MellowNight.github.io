## Introduction

Since many years ago, kernel drivers that expose specific primitives that allow arbitrary usermode inputs have been leveraged for privilege escalation. Multiple PoC projects have been written to manually map code into the kernel using signed vulnerable drivers, including z175's KDMapper, which exploits MmMapIoSpace in Intel's driver, and xeroxz's MsrExec, which exploits a msr write primitive in corsair's iCUE driver. Recently, threat actors such as Scattered Spider have been attempting to utilize KDMapper to bypass Crowdstrike's EDR in cyberattacks targeting ISP companies. Abusing a vulnerable driver to map rootkits is an effective technique for getting around security software and establishing persistence.

Exploitable kernel driver primitives include:
- Arbitrary physical memory read/write (MmMapIoSpace, ZwMapViewOfSection, )
- MSR write instructions (can be used to write to IA32_LSTAR syscall handler address MSR)
- in/out port access (can be used to overwrite kernel images on disk, for kernel code execution)
- Arbitrary kernel memory read/write 

What if you wanted to find your own vulnerable driver? There are numerous public tools for finding vulnerable drivers, but almost all of them simply parse the drivers' import tables for physical memory mapping functions. It takes many hours to manually examine each driver to see if its exploitable imports can be triggered with arbitrary parameters from usermode.

After doing some more googling, I came across POPKORN, an angr-based framework for performing taint analysis on drivers to automatically find exploitable MmMapIoSpace, ZwMapViewOfSection, and ZwOpenProcess primitives. 

I was inspired by POPKORN to create r00tFind, a symbolic execution-driven vulnerable driver scanner. Not only did I want to be able to identify vulnerable physical memory mapping routines, but I also wanted to broaden the symbolic execution to discover other exploitable primitives.

### Symbolic execution

To start off, I needed to find all of the I/O dispatch routines of the driver, because user input is passed to the dispatch routine through the IRP (I/O request packet). Since I/O routines are set up in the driver object passed to DriverEntry(). I used DFS (depth-first search) on DriverEntry, guided by symbolic execution, to explore the function with symbolic inputs. 

After finding every I/O routine in the driver, taint analysis on the inputs passed through the IRP.

I had to choose a symbolic execution framework to use as the basis for r00tFind:

- Angr: This is probably the easiest symbolic execution framework to use, with built in functions for path exploration, but it was entirely coded in Python, and I didn't want to work with python.
- MIASM: Same as above
- Triton: Triton is programmed in C++ and provides a nice, simple API, but it doesn't properly support snapshotting/path exploration.
- S2E: S2E has unparalleled performance due to it using QEMU or KVM as a emulation backend. However, every driver needed a unique s2e environment configuration, and setting up an s2e environment involved a million steps, so it was best used for analyzing complex software systems with multiple parts. I eventually realized that S2E wasn't just a symbolic execution framework, but an entire tool built around the KLEE framework.
- KLEE: KLEE is basically just the core of S2E, without any of the bells and whistles. I could've used McSema to lift the compiled drivers to LLVM and pass the bitcode to KLEE, but my harness was required to be compiled into the LLVM bitcode of the binary, which I really didnt want to do bc that meant injecting code into the thing 

I eventually went with MAAT,

## Sandboxing 

## Read Write logging
