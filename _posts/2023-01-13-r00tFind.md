## Introduction

Kernel drivers that expose certain functionalities with arbitrary user inputs have been leveraged for privilege escalation for many years. Examples of vulnerable kernel drivers in the wild include the gigabyte drivers 

At the same time, there has been some security research surrounding vulnerable drivers. In this post,  Most public implementations of vulnerable driver scanners simply scanned the imports of , so I decided to write a tool. 


## VM setup 

## VM exit

## Sandboxing 

## Read Write logging

## Branch Tracing

## Process-specific syscall hooks

## Nested Page Table hooks
