## About me

Hello! 
<br>

I'm a 17 year old in the USA who is passionate about low-level programming and cybersecurity. I've been programming since I was 13, but I've only recently begun working on large projects. I have a special focus on Windows internals, reverse engineering, and virtualization tech.

<br>

#### By the end of 2023, I hope to finish two projects: 
 *  Windows kernel driver fuzzing (~3 months)
 *  EasyAntiCheat reversal (7-8 months).
