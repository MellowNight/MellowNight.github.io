## About me

Hello! 

I'm a 17 year old in the USA who is passionate about low-level programming and cybersecurity. I've been programming since I was 13, but I've only recently begun working on large, long-term projects. I have a special focus on Windows internals, software obfuscation, and virtualization technology.

My long-term goal is to eventually do professional vulnerability research.  

##### By the end of 2023, I hope to finish two projects: 
 *  Windows kernel driver fuzzing (~3 months)
 *  EasyAntiCheat reversal (6-7 months).
